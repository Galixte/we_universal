phpBB style: [we_universal](https://inventea.com/en/projects/we_universal)
==========================================================================

we_universal is a modern, clean style for **phpBB 3.0** and **phpBB 3.1**.
It uses principles of flat design and Responsive Web Design technique. Fits
great on desktops and various mobile devices. Suitable for any kind of forum
communities. Compatible with all major browsers.

Based on default prosilver style. Built using [template and asset
inheritance](https://www.phpbb.com/styles/create/#a-inheritance) which
simplifies customisation and updating. All custom CSS classes are prefixed with
`inventea-` namespace (previously `inventia-`). Since we_universal 2.4.0 single
`we_universal.css` file is split into smaller files corresponding to the
prosilver structure.

**Caution: phpBB 3.0 and phpBB 3.1 styles are not compatible.** For phpBB 3.0
